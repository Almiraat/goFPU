# This is not a phish!

Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you just received? Well, it was a fake (Sorry, no rewards... and no secret lottery this year). And that FPU Login page you just clicked through? Well, yes, it was also a fake. The good news is, it's only me who's sitting on this side of the screen. A friend, in other words. It could have been someone else.... much, much "badder" :)

But let's be honest. I could have fallen for this. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, no one is going to be named or shamed :)

Your credentials have not been compromised. So, no reason to worry and no need to change your password.

I want, however, to use this opportunity to leave you with a few good thoughts. So please read on for a few more seconds.

# What just happened?

Most of us rarely pay attention to the spelling of the sender's email address. A closer look at the address of the fake email you received would have revealed that it is not from {freepressunlimited.org}, as it should be, but from {fr**eee**pressunlimited.org}, with a triple "e".

That should have been your first flag. :)

The second, was the link inside of the email itself. Again, a closer look at the URL would have revealed that you were about to visit a page that is not {login.freepressunlimited.org}, our legitimate login page. 

The login page was obviously a fake even though it looks legitimate. It is a clone.

I made a few clone examples for you so you can see for yourselves: <a href="https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Gmail.login/" target="_blank">here, a fake Gmail login page</a>; and <a href="https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Facebook/" target="_blank">here a fake Facebook login page</a>. 

Take a look at the URL of each of those pages. Does it look legitimate?


Be advised also that those phishing messages don't always take the form of emails. They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/technology/personaltech/spotting-the-phish-in-a-sea-of-email.html" target="_blank">can be sent to your phone email app</a>, sent via SMS text messages, WhatsApp or Signal messages, or any other communication means. 

Ultimately, it is your common sense that is the sure guard against them.

# So, what to do?*

### Learn to spot suspicious emails
- Learn a few simple practices and common tactics used to trick people into clicking on malicious links and attachments.

## BUTTON

- Regularly test your knowledge. Take this quiz:
    
## BUTTON

### Check a website's name
Look to the right end of the website URL for the name before .com or other ending (like .nl). Is it the site you want to go to?

### Then check for the letter "S" in "HTTPS” or look for a green ‘padlock’ icon in your URL bar

Any website that asks for your information should have HTTPS, but know that HTTPS alone does not make a website genuine.

### In doubt, seek help

If you are still unsure, feel free to ask for help from myself or Greenhost. You can also check a suspicious website yourself with the online scanning engine <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a>.
