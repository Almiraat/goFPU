# That was a phish!

Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you just received. Well, it was a fake (Sorry, no rewards... and no secret lottery this year). And that FPU Login page you just clicked through. Well, yes, it was also a fake. The good news is, I am the one sitting on this side of the screen. It could have been a bad person. Easily.

But I'll be honest with you here. I could have fallen for this. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, anyway, no one is going to be named or shamed :)

But I do want to use this opportunity to leave you with a few good advice. So please, bare with me and read on.

Most of us rarely pay attention to the spelling of the sender's email address. A closer look at the address of the fake email you received would have revealed that it is not from {freepressunlimited.org}, as it should be, but from {fr**eee**pressunlimited.org}, with a triple "e".

That should have been your first flag. :)

The second, was the link inside of the email itself. Again, a closer look at the URL would have revealed that you were about to visit, not {login.freepressunlimited.org}, our legitimate login page, but {fr**eee**pressunlimited.org/FPU-login}. 

The login page was obviously a fake even though it looks legitimate. It is a clone.

I made a few examples clones so you see for yourselves: [here, a fake Gmail login page](https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Gmail.login/); and [here a fake Facebook login page](https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Facebook/). Pay attention to the URL of each of those pages. Does it look legitimate?

# What advice

### Check the website name
Look to the right end of the website URL for the name before .com or other ending (like .nl). Is it the site you want to go to?
