# That was a phish!

Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you just received. Well, it was a fake (Sorry, no rewards... and no secret lottery this year). And that FPU Login page you just clicked through. Well, yes, it was also a fake. The good news is, I am the one sitting on this side of the screen. It could have been a bad person. Easily.

But I'll be honest with you here. I could have fallen for this. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, anyway, no one is going to be named or shamed :)

But I do want to use this opportunity to leave you with a few good advice. So please, bare with me and read on.

Most of us rarely pay attention to the spelling of the sender's email address. A closer look at the address of the fake email you received will reveal that it is not from freepressunlimited.org, as it should, but from fr**eee**pressunlimited.org, with a triple "e".

That should have been your first flag. :)

The second was the link inside of the email. A closer look at the URL will reveal that you are visiting, not {login.freepressunlimited.org}, our legitimate login page, but {freeepressunlimited.org/fpu-login}.
