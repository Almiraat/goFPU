Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you received was a fake. And that FPU Login page you clicked through was also a fake. The good news is that none of your data was compromised. This is just an exercise. It could have been worse though. Because bad guys could possibly be sitting we're I am sitting right now and could have chosen to steal your password.

I'll be honest with. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, anyway, I am not going to name nor shame :)
