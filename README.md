# That was a phish!

Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you just received. Well, it was a fake (Sorry, no rewards... and no secret lottery this year). And that FPU Login page you just clicked through. Well, yes, it was also a fake. The good news is, I am the one sitting on this side of the screen. It could have been a bad person. Easily.

But I'll be honest with you here. I could have fallen for this. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, anyway, no one is going to be named or shamed :)

But I do want to use this opportunity to leave you with a few good advice. So please, bare with me and read on.

Most of us rarely pay attention to the spelling of the sender's email address. A closer look at the address of the fake email you received would have revealed that it is not from {freepressunlimited.org}, as it should be, but from {fr**eee**pressunlimited.org}, with a triple "e".

That should have been your first flag. :)

The second, was the link inside of the email itself. Again, a closer look at the URL would have revealed that you were about to visit, not {login.freepressunlimited.org}, our legitimate login page, but {fr**eee**pressunlimited.org/FPU-login}. 

The login page was obviously a fake even though it looks legitimate. It is a clone.

I made a few examples clones so you see for yourselves: [here, a fake Gmail login page](https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Gmail.login/); and [here a fake Facebook login page](https://almiraat.github.io/goFPU/Facebook/). Pay attention to the URL of each of those pages. Does it look legitimate?

# What advice

### Check a website's name
Look to the right end of the website URL for the name before .com or other ending (like .nl). Is it the site you want to go to?

### Then check for the letter "S" in "HTTPS” or look for a green ‘padlock’ icon in your URL bar

Any website that asks for your information should have HTTPS, but know that HTTPS alone does not make a website genuine.

### In doubt, ask for help

If you are still unsure, feel free to ask for help from myself, Greenhost. You can also check a suspicious website with the online scanning engine [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url).
