Hey there,

It's Hisham from FPU :)

That email you just received. Well, it was a fake. And that FPU Login page you just clicked through. yes, it was also a fake. The good news is, I am the one sitting on this side of the screen. It could have been a bad person. Easily.

But I'll be honest with you here. I could have fallen for this. Anyone could have fallen for this. So don't feel guilty. And, anyway, no one is going to be named or shamed :)
